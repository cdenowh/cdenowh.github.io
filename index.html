                <h2>Terry Anderson<br><small><em>On Public Land & Public Access</em></small></h2>
                        <p>Terry Anderson is the William A. Dunn Distinguished Senior Fellow and former President and Executive Director of PERC as well as the John and Jean De Nault Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He believes that market approaches can be both economically sound and environmentally sensitive. His research helped launch the idea of free market environmentalism and has prompted public debate over the proper role of government in managing natural resources. He is the co-chair of Hoover's Property Rights, Freedom, and Prosperity Task Force.</p>
 
                        <p>Anderson is the author or editor of thirty-seven books. Among these, Free Market Environmentalism, co-authored with Donald Leal, received the 1992 Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award. A revised edition was published in 2001.</p>
 
                        <p>Terry and Donald Leal’s most recent book, Free Market Environmentalism for the Next Generation, was published in 2015. His most recent publications are Environmental Markets a Property Rights Approach (Cambridge University Press, 2014) and  Tapping Water Markets (RFF Press, 2012). Other books include Greener Than Thou: Are You Really an Environmentalist? (Hoover Institution Press, 2008) and Property Rights: A Practical Guide to Freedom and Prosperity (Hoover Institution Press, 2003), both co-authored with Laura Huggins. His book, with Peter J. Hill, The Not So Wild, Wild West: Property Rights on the Frontier (Stanford University Press), was awarded the 2005 Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award.</p>
 
                        <p>Anderson’s research, which has also focused on Native American economies, recently resulted in a co-edited volume, Self-Determination: The Other Path for Native Americans (Stanford University Press, 2006). He has published widely in the popular press and professional journals, including the Wall Street Journal, the Christian Science Monitor, Fly Fisherman, Journal of Law and Economics, and Economic Inquiry. During his career at Montana State University, Anderson received several outstanding teaching awards and is now professor emeritus of economics. He received his B.S. from the University of Montana and earned a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Washington. In March 2011, Anderson received the Liberalni Institute Annual Award in Prague, Czech Republic, for his "Contribution to the Proliferation of Liberal Thinking, and Making Ideas of Liberty, Private Property, Competition, and the Rule of Law Come True.” Previous recipients include Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, Gary Becker, and Vernon Smith.</p>

                <h2>Harriet Hageman<br><small><em>On Regulation without Representation</em></small></h2>
                        <p>Harriet Hageman grew up on a ranch near Fort Laramie, Wyoming. She attended Casper College on a Livestock Judging Scholarship from 1981-1983, and received her B.S. Degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming in 1986. In 1989, she graduated from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Her first position was as a clerk for the Honorable James E. Barrett, a Judge on the United States Appellate Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit. She is currently licensed to practice law in the States of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado.</p>

                        <p>Harriet has worked on many water and natural resource matters, including Nebraska v. Wyoming; the “roadless litigation”; challenges to the Fish & Wildlife Service’s management and recovery of the Canadian gray wolf and other species; protection of private property from contaminated discharges; predator control; defense of Wyoming’s “open range” law; protection of grazing rights on BLM and private lands; snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park; and protection of water rights as a Wyoming attorney.</p>

                        <p>She represents several irrigation districts around the State, addressing such matters as protection of irrigated agriculture and the impact of land use changes.</p>

                        <p>Harriet’s practice in Nebraska is primarily addressed to the relationship between ground water and surface water, including analysis and implementation of the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. She was one of the attorneys in Spear T Ranch, Inc., v. Knaub et al. She also works with local Natural Resource Districts to deal with the impacts of the Endangered Species Act and the Republican River Compact.</p>

                        <p>Harriet is actively involved with addressing the impact of federal and state regulations on land and water use. In 2004, in a continuing effort to inform the general public regarding that regulatory environment, she formed the Wyoming Resource Alliance, working to increase public participation at both the State and Federal regulatory level. She hopes to expand the WRA concept into a regional and national resource.</p>

                        <p>Harriet is on the Advisory Board of the Rocky Mountain Land Use Institute, the Steering Committee for the Wyoming Business Alliance, and the Board of Litigation for the Mountain States Legal Foundation. Ms. Hageman was honored by Casper College as the Distinguished Alumni for 2011, and was inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame in 2011.</p>
